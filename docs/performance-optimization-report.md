# Performance Optimization Report for cascette-rs

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance characteristics of all crates in the cascette-rs project and provides actionable optimization recommendations. Based on benchmark analysis and code review, we've identified significant optimization opportunities that could improve performance by 30-50% across various components.

## Crate-by-Crate Analysis

### 1. ngdp-bpsv (BPSV Parser)

**Current Performance Characteristics:**
- Small document (10 rows): ~2.96 µs
- Medium document (100 rows): ~25.8 µs
- Large document (1000 rows): ~249 µs
- Complex document (100x20): ~171 µs

**Key Bottlenecks:**
- Excessive string allocations during parsing
- Multiple passes over data
- Inefficient field lookup mechanisms

**High-Priority Optimizations:**
1. **Zero-Copy Parsing**: Implement parsing that works directly with string slices
2. **Field Index Caching**: Pre-compute field indices instead of HashMap lookups
3. **Streaming Parser**: Process lines iteratively instead of collecting all upfront
4. **String Interning**: Reuse common strings (regions, field names)

**Expected Impact:** 30-40% reduction in parsing time

### 2. tact-client (TACT Response Parser)

**Current Performance Characteristics:**
- parse_versions: ~4.9 µs
- parse_cdns: ~7.0 µs
- parse_large_cdns (20 entries): ~22.1 µs

**Key Bottlenecks:**
- Repeated schema lookups for each field access
- Unnecessary string allocations
- Redundant parsing logic

**High-Priority Optimizations:**
1. **Cache Field Indices**: Store field positions once per parse operation
2. **Reduce Allocations**: Use `Cow<str>` for fields that might not need allocation
3. **Optimize List Parsing**: Single method for space-separated value parsing
4. **Pre-allocate Vectors**: Use `with_capacity()` based on row count

**Expected Impact:** 35-45% improvement in parsing speed

### 3. ribbit-client (Ribbit Protocol Client)

**Current Performance Characteristics:**
- Region parsing: Sub-microsecond
- Endpoint path generation: ~100 ns per endpoint
- Command formatting: ~200 ns

**Key Bottlenecks:**
- DNS resolution on every request
- String allocations in command formatting
- MIME parsing overhead for V1 protocol
- Response parsing allocations

**High-Priority Optimizations:**
1. **DNS Caching**: Cache resolved addresses to avoid repeated lookups
2. **Response Caching**: Add TTL-based response cache (most important optimization)
3. **Command Buffer Reuse**: Pre-allocate command buffers
4. **Direct BPSV Parsing**: Skip String conversion step
5. **Specialized MIME Parser**: Replace generic email parser for V1
6. **Endpoint Path Caching**: Cache formatted endpoint paths

**Note:** Connection pooling is NOT possible with Ribbit as the server closes connections after each response.

**Expected Impact:** 40-60% reduction in request latency through caching and reduced allocations

### 4. ngdp-cdn (CDN Client)

**Current Performance Characteristics:**
- URL building: ~50 ns
- Client creation: ~1 µs
- Backoff calculation: ~10 ns

**Key Bottlenecks:**
- No parallel download support
- Basic retry logic
- No request deduplication
- Missing range request support

**High-Priority Optimizations:**
1. **Parallel Downloads**: Batch download support with concurrency limits
2. **Smart Retry Logic**: Different strategies based on error type
3. **CDN Fallback**: Automatic failover without waiting
4. **Range Requests**: Support partial downloads
5. **Request Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate concurrent requests

**Expected Impact:** 3-5x improvement for bulk downloads

### 5. ngdp-cache (Caching Layer)

**Current Performance Characteristics:**
- Generic cache write (1MB): ~2-3 ms
- Generic cache read (1MB): ~1-2 ms
- Path construction: ~200 ns
- Concurrent operations show linear scaling

**Key Bottlenecks:**
- Blocking I/O in async context
- No buffering for large files
- Repeated path allocations
- Linear directory scanning

**High-Priority Optimizations:**
1. **Async File Operations**: Fix blocking `.exists()` calls
2. **Buffered I/O**: Add buffering for large file operations
3. **Path Caching**: Pre-compute and cache common paths
4. **Batch Operations**: Support multiple operations in single call
5. **Memory-Mapped Files**: For large read-heavy workloads

**Expected Impact:** 25-35% improvement in I/O operations

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days)
- Fix blocking I/O in ngdp-cache
- Add field index caching to tact-client
- Implement DNS caching in ribbit-client
- Add batch operations to ngdp-cache

### Phase 2: Core Optimizations (3-5 days)
- Implement zero-copy parsing in ngdp-bpsv
- Add parallel download support to ngdp-cdn
- Create specialized MIME parser for ribbit-client
- Implement streaming I/O in ngdp-cache

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1 week)
- Add request deduplication across all clients
- Implement comprehensive caching strategy
- Add memory-mapped file support
- Create performance monitoring infrastructure

## Benchmarking Strategy

1. **Micro-benchmarks**: Continue using Criterion for component-level performance
2. **Integration benchmarks**: Add end-to-end performance tests
3. **Real-world scenarios**: Test with actual WoW client data
4. **Continuous monitoring**: Track performance regressions in CI

## Performance Targets

Based on the analysis, realistic performance targets are:

- **BPSV Parsing**: 30-40% faster
- **TACT Parsing**: 35-45% faster
- **Ribbit Requests**: 40-60% faster (through caching and reduced allocations)
- **CDN Downloads**: 3-5x faster (bulk operations)
- **Cache Operations**: 25-35% faster

## Memory Usage Improvements

1. **String Interning**: Reduce memory for repeated strings
2. **Streaming Operations**: Process large files without full buffering
3. **Zero-Copy Parsing**: Eliminate unnecessary allocations
4. **Buffer Pooling**: Reuse buffers across operations

## Conclusion

The cascette-rs project has a solid foundation but significant performance improvements are achievable through the optimizations outlined in this report. Implementing these changes will result in:

- Faster content downloads and parsing
- Reduced memory usage
- Better scalability for concurrent operations
- Improved user experience for WoW emulation servers

The optimizations are ordered by impact and implementation complexity, allowing for incremental improvements while maintaining code quality and test coverage.
