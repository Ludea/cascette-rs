  - Displays build version, creation date, build config, and type (Full/BGDL)
  - Support for JSON, BPSV, and formatted text output
  - Caching support with 30-minute TTL to reduce API load

### Fixed

- **Conflicting short command-line flags**:
  - Removed `-l` short flag from `--limit` in `products builds` command (was conflicting with `-l` for `--log-level`)
  - Removed `-d` short flag from `--days` in `products builds` command (was conflicting with `-d` for `--details` in `certs download`)
  - Removed `-o` short flag from `--output` in `download build` and `download files` commands (was conflicting with global `-o` for `--format`)

- **Enhanced `config show` command**:
  - Now shows all available settings with their default values, not just the three basic ones
  - Added settings: `cache_enabled`, `cache_ttl`, `max_concurrent_downloads`, `user_agent`, `verify_certificates`, `proxy_url`, `ribbit_timeout`, `tact_timeout`, `retry_attempts`, `log_file`, `color_output`, `fallback_to_tact`, `use_community_cdn_fallbacks`, `custom_cdn_fallbacks`
  - All settings are now accessible via `config get` command

- **Code quality improvements**:
  - Fixed clippy warnings in examples (uninlined_format_args)
  - Applied consistent code formatting
